SQL PROJECT : MUSIC STORE ANALYSIS 

This music sales database project utilizes SQL queries, encompassing diverse functions like SUM, COUNT, and ORDER BY, to extract crucial insights such as top-spending customers, popular genres, and highest-selling artists. Through meticulous analysis and leveraging SQL's capabilities, it aims to unveil key patterns and trends within the music sales domain.

Learnings:

1. Data Aggregation: The project extensively uses aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG to derive insights by summarizing data across multiple records.

2. Joins: Utilizes different types of SQL joins (JOIN, INNER JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns.

3. Subqueries: Makes use of subqueries to nest one query within another, allowing for more complex conditions or computations.

4. Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Utilizes CTEs to create temporary result sets, improving readability and reusability of queries.

5. Window Functions: Employs window functions like ROW_NUMBER() with OVER(PARTITION BY...) to perform calculations over a specific window or subset of rows.

Functions Used:

Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG), TOP, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, OFFSET and FETCH NEXT for pagination, and PARTITION BY for partition-level calculations were utilized.
